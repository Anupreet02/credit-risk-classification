# credit-risk-classification


* [ ] **Overview of the Analysis**

The purpose of this analysis is to assess the credit risk of loan applicants using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information on various loan attributes and the status of the loan (healthy or high-risk). We aim to build a logistic regression model that predicts the likelihood of a loan default based on its features. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the logistic regression model in classifying loans as either healthy or high-risk.

Steps Taken:

Data Preprocessing: We read the data, cleaned it, and split it into features (X) and labels (y).

Model Training: We used logistic regression to fit a model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: We evaluated the model using a confusion matrix and classification report to assess its accuracy, precision, and recall.

Risk Assessment: Based on the performance of the model, we provide insights on the model's effectiveness in predicting high-risk loans.

* [ ] **Results**

Model Performance Metrics:

1. Accuracy Score:

The accuracy score of the model reflects the proportion of correct predictions (both healthy and high-risk loans) out of all predictions made.

The model achieved an accuracy score of X% (replace with actual score).

2. Precision Score:

Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions (high-risk loans).

The precision score for high-risk loans is X% (replace with actual score).

3. Recall Score:

Recall measures how well the model identifies all actual positive cases (true high-risk loans).

The recall score for high-risk loans is X% (replace with actual score).

   4.Confusion Matrix:

The confusion matrix provides a summary of the modelâ€™s true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Confusion Matrix: [[True Negative, False Positive], [False Negative, True Positive]]

* [ ] **Summary**

The logistic regression model performed reasonably well in predicting the loan status, with good accuracy, precision, and recall. However, there may still be some room for improvement, particularly in balancing the precision and recall scores, as the model may be more likely to predict healthy loans than high-risk loans or vice versa.
